Title: Which poisoned patients require treatment in the intensive care
unit? A pilot study of the INTOXICATE Clinical Decision Rule

Backgrdound: Our overall goal is to reduce unnecessary admissions to the
intensive care unit (ICU). INTOXICATE (ex-TOXIC-Europe study) is a
clinical decision rule developed in the Netherlands to predict which
poisoned patients will require ventilatory or vasopressor support.
INTOXICATE reduced ICU admissions for poisoned patients by one-third in
the Netherlands.

Objective: Determine the applicability of INTOXICATE to poisoned
patients in the US.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of data from a bedside toxicology consultation services at one academic medical center. The data used for this study are gathered as part of the service's quality assurance and participation in ToxIC, a national registry of poisoned patients treated by toxicologists. Our measure of interest was the inter-rater reliability between the clinical decision rule and the treating physician\'s decision.

Results: We included X patients, median age X years, interquartile
range \[X-X\]; X% male. X identified as non-binary. We excluded X
patients because their discharge presentations were ultimately
determined not to be related to poisoning or they were not
hemodynamically unstable or in respiratory failure at the time of
presentation. Of the remaining X patients, X were admitted to the ICU,
X to the floor, and X discharged. INTOXICATE predicted that all X
patients admitted to the ICU should be admitted to the ICU. It predicted
that X of the X patients admitted to the floor should be admitted to the
ICU. None of these X patients admitted to the floor that INTOXICATE
predicted needing ICU level of care were transferred from the floor to
the ICU or Stepdown Unit. All X had a length of stay in the Emergency
Department greater than X hours, were on naloxone infusions. One also
received octreotide. We did not calculate the inter-rater reliability
because we obtained too few samples to accurately estimate Cohen\'s
kappa. All records contained the fields needed to calculate the
INTOXICATE risk score and inter-rater reliability.

Conclusions: In this small sample, INTOXICATE identified all patients
who required admission to the ICU, but predicted that some patients
required ICU care when they did not, increasing ICU utilization. Our
sample size was too small to calculate inter-rater reliability. Future
work can do so on a larger sample.
