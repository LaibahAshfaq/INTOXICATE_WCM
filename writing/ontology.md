The <u> mathematical </u> definition of equivalence class is the collection of all inputs that give the same output with respect to some function. One may define a <u>clinical</u> similarity measure and characterize each collection by the distribution of values of those functions. Collections with wider distributions contain more clinically heterogeneous patients and so are more surprising.
