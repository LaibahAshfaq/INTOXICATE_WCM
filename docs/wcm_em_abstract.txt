Title: Do abnormal electrocardiographic intervals predict death in poisoned patients older than 65 years?Objectives: Determine the predictive value of a QRS wider than 0.12s and corrected QT longer than 0.5s in all-cause mortality in poisoned patients older than 65?Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of data from ToxIC, a multisite registry of poisoned patients evaluated by a toxicologist. We calculated the odds ratio between age over 65 and all-cause mortality during that hospitalization.  We considered all cases from 2000 to the present because the year 2000 is the oldest one for which electrocardiographic data were recorded as a core measurement of the registry.  The study received an exemption from the IRB as 'Not Human Subjects Research' because it involved a secondary analysis of previously collected and deidentified data. Results: We identified 64,308 patients between 2000 and 2024, of whom 4,424 were older than 65 years. Of these patients, 60, 967 (3,908) had their clinical outcome, electrocardiographic intervals, age, and gender identity recorded. For patients over 65 years of age, the median age (interquartile range) was 74 (69-85) years. They were 72% male and none identified as nonbinary.  In those over 65 years, the odds ratio for mortality if the QRS was greater than 0.12s on any EKG was 4.12 (95% CI 2.5 to 7.0). The odds ratio for mortality if the corrected QT was greater than 0.5s on any EKG was 1.93 (95% CI: 1.16 to 3.20). The fragility indices for each odds ratio were each greater than 20. In the general population, the odds ratios were 6.05 (4.89 to 7.49) and 2.93 (2.42 to 3.54), respectively.Conclusions: Abnormal EKG intervals may be a less useful predictor of all-cause mortality in poisoned patients older than 65 years than in the general population. In patients older than 65 years poisoned by at least one agent and evaluated by a medical toxicologist, any EKG with a QRS wider than 0.120 s was associated with an approximately 4-fold increased likelihood of death during that hospitalization and corrected QT longer than 0.5 s with an approximately 2-fold increased likelihood of death. In the general population, a widened QRS is associated with a 6-fold increase in the likelihood of death and a prolonged QT with a 3-fold increase. This lower predictive value in those older than 65 years may reflect the increasing prevalence of ischemic heart disease and bundle branch blocks with age, the confounding effects of prescribed medications, and the different choice of substances. It may reflect a bias in registry data, where poisoned elderly patients with EKG changes were cared for by cardiology without toxicology. Our findings motivate future work to determine the sources of variation in the predictive value of EKG intervals with respect to age, poisoning type, and underlying bundle branch block.
