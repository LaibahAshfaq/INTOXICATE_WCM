Exposure Category
-	The categories available are limiting. Exposures within our data set that do not fit into current categories include: 
o	Fentanyl – both street drug and analgesic but for the sake of classification in our data set we designated it “street drug” 
o	Methadone  - doesn’t fit within the categories available but for the sake of fitting it within the options we’ve designated it as “street drug” as well 

Respiratory Insufficiency
-	“Yes” was selected if the patient required any type of support in the ED i.e. intubation, nasal cannula

Dysrhythmia
-	Parameters of inclusion are: 
o	 SVT
o	Afib
o	Vfib
o	Tachycardia (pulse > 100)
o	Bradycardia (pulse < 40)
-	We did not include STEMI

Actual Disposition
-	We used three categories: GMF, ICU, and Discharge
-	SDU = ICU
-	The three categories do not take into consideration all scenarios such as transfers and patients who AMA. We have no transfers in our initial data set. We have one patient who left AMA and have classified them as “Discharge”.

Pulse, SBP, GCS
-	Initial ED values were used
